# BulletHell
Unity video-game that uses object pooling for bullets and object instancing for enemies on the screen.
Move with WASD, slow motion with left shift and shoot with left click (you can hold)

## Phase one
Enemies appear until the max_amount of enemies has been reached. After a timer has finished, they despawn and Phase 2 begins

## Phase two
Phase two is the boss phase, where the boss changes patterns (movement and shooting) every 10 seconds.
- Shoots (enormous) circles
- Shoots z-line spray
- Shoots death ray (dense)

If you succed, the game continues until you lose all your HP (10 hits). Good luck!
