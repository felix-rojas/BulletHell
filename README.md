# BulletHell
Unity video-game that uses object pooling for bullets and object instancing for enemies on the screen.

## Phase one
Enemies appear until the max_amount of enemies has been reached. After a timer has finished, they despawn and Phase 2 begins

## Phase two
Phase two is the boss phase, where the boss changes patterns (movement and shooting) every 10 seconds.
- Shoots (enormous) circles
- Shoots z-line spray
- Shoots death ray (dense)

If you succed, the game continues until you lose all your HP (10 hits). Good luck!
